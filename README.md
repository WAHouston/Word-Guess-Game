# Word-Guess-Game
### This is a fantasy-themed, hangman-style, word guessing game.
#### Gameplay
* Players guess letters in an attempt to figure out what fantasy-themed word they have been given by pressing letter keys on their keyboard.
* When a player guesses a letter that is contained in the given word, the space that letter would occupy in the word is filled in with the correct letter.
* If a player guesses a wrong letter, that letter is displayed in the wrong letter bank.
* If a player guesses incorrectly ten times, the round ends and a new word is chosen.
* If a player correctly guesses the given word, the round ends, the win counter increases, and a new word is chosen.
#### Purpose
* The word guess game demonstrates usage and understanding of fundamental concepts of Javascript such as for loops, if statements, and arrays.
